\section{STTs with one unary register}
\label{sec:one-register}

% \begin{definition}
%     Let $\Sigma$ be a ranked set. We can view $\trees \Sigma$ as a multisorted algebra as follows.
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item the sorts are arities;
%         \item the elements of arity $n$ are $n$-ary terms in $\Sigma$;
%         \item for every ranked set $X$ and every $t \in \trees (\Sigma+X)$ there is an operation
%         \begin{align*}
%             (\trees \Sigma)^X \to \trees \Sigma
%         \end{align*}
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{definition}
% Define $\aalg_\Sigma$ to be the multisorted algebra where:


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:one-register}
    Let $f$ be recognised by a first-order definable streaming tree transducer, which has one register that is unary. Then $f$ is first-order tree function.
\end{lemma}
