\section{Chain logic and general unfold}
\label{sec:appendix-chain}
In this section, we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:chain-transductions}, which says that adding general unfold to \mso yields exactly the chain logic tree-to-tree transductions. For the rest of this section, we use the word ``derivable'' to mean derivable in the extension of Definition~\ref{def:derivable-function} where general unfold is used instead of monotone unfold.
