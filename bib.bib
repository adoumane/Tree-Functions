	abstract = {The first main result is that if a macro tree translation is of linear size increase, i.e., if the size of every output tree is linearly bounded by the size of the corresponding input tree, then the translation is MSO definable (i.e., definable in monadic second-order logic). This gives a new characterization of the MSO definable tree translations in terms of macro tree transducers: they are exactly the macro tree translations of linear size increase. The second main result is that given a macro tree transducer, it can be decided whether or not its translation is MSO definable, and if it is, then an equivalent MSO transducer can be constructed. Similar results hold for attribute grammars, which define a subclass of the macro tree translations.},

	abstract = {Two well-known formalisms for the specification and computation of tree transductions are compared: the mso graph transducer and the attributed tree transducer with look-ahead, respectively. The mso graph transducer, restricted to trees, uses monadic second order logic to define the output tree in terms of the input tree. The attributed tree transducer is an attribute grammar in which all attributes are trees; it is preceded by a look-ahead phase in which all attributes have finitely many values. The main result is that these formalisms are equivalent, i.e., that the attributed tree transducer with look-ahead is an appropriate implementation model for the tree transductions that are specifiable in mso logic. This result holds for mso graph transducers that produce trees with shared subtrees. If no sharing is allowed, the attributed tree transducer satisfies the single use restriction.},
