\section{Decomposing the prime function unfold}
\label{ap:matrix-power}
\newcommand{\treeunfold}{\mathrm{unfold}}

Among our prime functions, the less satisfactory one is certainly the unfloding function. In this section, we will decompose it into a collection of functions containing no form of iteration. 



\subsection{New prime functions replacing the unfolding}\label{sec:functions-decomposing-unfolding}

The prime functions which are intended to replace the unfolding function use a new datatype constructor called \emph{shallow terms}. it is defined as follows.  

\paragraph*{Shallow terms.} Let $\rSigma$ and $\rGamma$ be two ranked sets. An element of the shallow terms datatype denoted $\shallowterm \rSigma \rGamma$, is an expression of the form $a\tensorpair{b_1,\dots,b_n}$ where $a$ is an $n$-ary element of $\rSigma$ and $b_1,\dots, b_n$ are elements of $\rGamma$. We draw shallow terms like this:

Clearly, a shallow term is just a particular case of terms.

\paragraph*{New prime functions.} Let us present now the prime functions which will replace the unfolding function. Prime functions of Figure~\ref{fig:prime-for-shallow-terms} are some basic functions for the new shallow term datatype. Figure~\ref{fig:additional-distrib-prime} contains some new ditributivity laws and Figure~\ref{fig:additional-prime-for-fold} contains some additional laws for the fold datatype. Prime functions of Figure~\ref{fig:weak-unfolding} are weak versions of the unfolding function, containing no form of iteration.

The main result of this section is that the unfolding can be replaced by the more atomic functions of Figures~\ref{fig:prime-for-shallow-terms}, \ref{fig:additional-distrib-prime}, \ref{fig:additional-prime-for-fold} and ~\ref{fig:weak-unfolding}, in  presence of the other prime functions presented in Section~\ref{sec:derivable-functions}, as stated in the following theorem
 
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:decompose-unfolding}
The unfolding function can be derived using the functions of Figures~\ref{fig:prime-for-shallow-terms}, \ref{fig:additional-distrib-prime}, \ref{fig:additional-prime-for-fold}, ~\ref{fig:weak-unfolding}, and the prime functions of Section~\ref{sec:derivable-functions}.
\end{theorem}

%\subsection{Decomposing the unfolding function}\label{sec:proof-decompose-unfold}


Our proof strategy is to show that term unfolding can be derived for certain homogeneous (see below) monotone inputs, and then to show that every input can be decomposed into simpler inputs in a homogeneous way. The notion of homogeneous inputs, and the result about  decomposing of arbitrary inputs into homogeneous inputs, are presented in Section~\ref{sec:factfor}. Next, in Section~\ref{sec:homo-unfold}, we show how term unfolding can be done for homogeneous inputs. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:monotone-unfold-proof} we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:decompose-unfolding} by combining  the results of Sections~\ref{sec:factfor} and~\ref{sec:homo-unfold}.

\subsection{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:decompose-unfolding}}
\label{sec:monotone-unfold-proof}
In this section, we complete the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:decompose-unfolding}.  We say that a nested factorisation in $\tmonadn n \mati k \rSigma$ is \emph{monotone} if all of the labels from $\mati k \rSigma$ that appear in it are monotone. 
Consider the homomorphism which maps a branch to its corresponding twist, and which gives the completely undefined function in case the twist is not monotone.  The homomorphism uses an aperiodic monoid, as discussed in Example~\ref{ex:partial-monoton-functions}. 
 Apply the Factorisation Forest Theorem with respect to this homomorphism, yielding a derivable function
\begin{align*}
\ranked{ f : \tmonad \mati k \rSigma \to \tmonadn n \mati k \rSigma}
\end{align*}
which produces only nested factorisations that are  hereditarily homogeneous. (Also, because monotone functions are closed under composition, it follows that if  an input to $\ranked f$ is monotone, then the same is true for the output.) Therefore,  Theorem~\ref{thm:decompose-unfolding} follows by composing the function $\ranked f$ with the function $\ranked {g_n}$ from the following lemma. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:ind-homo-twist}
    For every finite ranked set $\rSigma$ and  $n \in \set{1,2,\ldots}$ there is a derivable function
    \begin{align*}
    \ranked{ g_n : \tmonadn n \mati k \rSigma \to \mati k \tmonad \rSigma}
    \end{align*}
    which makes the following diagram commute for inputs that are  monotone and  hereditarily homogeneous: 
    \begin{align*}
        \ranked{
            \xymatrix{
                \tmonadn n \mati k\rSigma \ar[d]_{\flatn n} \ar[rd]^g\\
                \tmonad  \mati k \rSigma \ar[r]_{\unfold}& \mati k \tmonad \rSigma 
            }
        }
    \end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Induction on $n$. To make the induction pass through, we also show that each function $\ranked{g_n}$ is consistent wit the  twist homomorphism in the following sense: for every input $t \in \tmonadn n \mati k \rSigma$, and every port $i \in \set{1,\ldots,\arity t}$, the same value is obtained by: (a) recursive flattening $t$ and then composing all of the twists that are found on the path from the root to port $i$; (b) applying $\ranked{g_n}$ and then computing the twist corresponding to port $i$. 
    
    For the induction base $n=1$, hereditarily homogeneous inputs are units, and there are finitely many of them and the function can be derived on a case by case basis. 
    
    Consider the induction step, where the lemma has already been proved for $n$ and we want to prove it for $n+1$. The function is the composition
    \begin{align*}
        \ranked{
            \xymatrix@C=1cm{
                \tmonadn {n+1} \mati k \Sigma \ar[r]^{\tmonad g_n} & \tmonad \mati k{(\tmonad \Sigma)} \ar[r]^{\text{Lemma~\ref{lem:homo-twist}}}&  \mati k  {(\tmonad \tmonad \rSigma)} \ar[r]^{\mati k \flatt} & \mati k \rSigma
            }
        }
    \end{align*}
    Consider a  hereditarily homogeneous input $t   \in \ranked{\tmonadn{n+1} \mati k \Sigma}$. 
    \begin{enumerate}
            \item Apply the function from the induction assumption to every label of $t$, i.e.~apply 
        \begin{align*}
        \ranked{
            \xymatrix{
                \tmonadn {n+1} \mati k \Sigma \ar[r]^{\tmonad g_n} & \tmonad \mati k{(\tmonad \Sigma)}
            }
        }
        \end{align*}
        \item Let $t_1$ be the output from the previous step. Because $\ranked {g_n}$ is consistent with twists, and $t$ is hereditarily homogeneous, it follows that $t_1$  is either a shallow term, or it is homogeneous with respect to the twist homomorphism.  If $t_1$ is a shallow term, then we apply the shallow unfolding operation from .. . Otherwise, we $t_1$ is homogeneous
        , because $t$ is hereditarily homogeneous and $\ranked{g_n}$ is consistent with twists. Therefore, we can apply the function
        from Lemma~\ref{lem:homo-twist}, with the alphabet being $\tmonad \rSigma$. 
        \item The result of the previous step is a term $t_2 \in \mati k {(\tmonad \tmonad \rSigma)}$. To this term, we apply $\mati k \flatt$, yielding the final result.
    \end{enumerate}
    A routine check shows that the function $\ranked{g_{n+1}}$ defined above satisfies the property in the statement of the lemma, and that it is furthermore consistent with the twist homomorphism.     
\end{proof}
