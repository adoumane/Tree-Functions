There is little need for justifying decomposition results, such as the Jordan-H\"older theorem in group theory, or the Krohn-Rhodes theorem in semigroup theory. For example, the Krohn-Rhodes theorem in semigroup theory says that every finite monoid can be decomposed, using wreath product, into semigroups that are either groups or a single three element monoid called $\mathcal U_2$. A consequence is that if a  property  is true for groups and $\mathcal U_2$ and preserved under wreath products, then the property is true for all finite semigroups. 

The goal of this paper is to establish a decomposition result for tree-to-tree functions.  (Maybe this is the wrong spin.)
