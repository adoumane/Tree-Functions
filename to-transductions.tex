\section{To transductions}
\label{sec:to-transductions}
In this section, we prove the bottom-up inclusion in Theorem~\ref{thm:main}:
\begin{align*}
    \text{first-order tree-to-tree interpretations} \qquad \supseteq \qquad \text{first-order tree functions}
\end{align*}
Since first-order tree functions are defined as tree restrictions of term-to-term functions, we need to work with first-order transductions that transforms terms (and elements of other types, such as pairs of terms, terms of terms, etc.). We begin by describing how elements of a type are encoded as models. 

\begin{center}
    (do this)
\end{center}


% For each type $\Sigma$ we define a coding
% \begin{align*}
%     t \in \Sigma \quad \mapsto \quad \underline t \in \text{models over $\hat \Sigma$}
% \end{align*}
% which represents elements of $t$ as
