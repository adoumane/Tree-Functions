\section{Monadic second-order transductions}
\label{sec:mso-trans}
In this paper, we have studied first-order tree-to-tree transductions. The more studied type of transductions is \mso tree-to-tree transductions, which are defined the same way as first-order tree-to-tree transductions except that monadic second-order logic \mso is used instead of first-order logic.
