\subsection{Term unfolding for homogeneous inputs}
\label{sec:homo-unfold}
For a monotone function 
\begin{align*}
\alpha: \set{1,\ldots,k} \to \set{1,\ldots,k}
\end{align*}
we say that a term $ t \in \tmonad \mati k \rSigma$ is $\alpha$-homogeneous if all internal branches have twist $\alpha$. This section is devoted to proving the following lemma. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:homo-twist}
    Let $k \in \set{1,2,\ldots}$ and let $\alpha : \set{1,\ldots,k} \to \set{1,\ldots,k}$ be a monotone function. There is a derivable operation 
    \begin{align*}
        \ranked{f : \tmonad \mati k \rSigma \to \mati k {(\tmonad \Sigma)} }
        \end{align*}      
which coincides with term unfolding for all inputs which are $\alpha$-homogeneous with respect to the matrix branch homomorphism.
\end{lemma}

The lemma is proved by induction on the size of the image of $\alpha$.
