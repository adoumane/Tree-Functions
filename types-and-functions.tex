\section{Derivable functions}\label{sec:derivable-functions}
In this section, we state the main result of this paper, which says that the  first-order tree-to-tree transductions are those that  can be  obtained by starting with certain prime functions (such as pre-order traversal from Example~\ref{ex:pre-order-main}) and applying certain  combinators (such as function composition). 

The guiding principle behind our approach is to describe tree-to-tree functions using a formalism devoid of any iteration mechanisms, such as states or {\tt fold} functions. This also validates the choice of first-order logic. If we would use \mso, at the very least we would need to have some mechanism for groups, which are a basic building block for Krohn-Rhodes decompositions, or for evaluating Boolean formulas. 


\subsection{Datatypes}
\label{sec:datatype-constructors}
Apart from trees, the prime functions and combinators  use  datatypes  such as pairs of trees or trees of trees, etc. Although these datatypes  could be encoded in trees, we avoid this encoding and use explicit datatype constructors. An important property of our datatypes is that they represent ranked sets, i.e.~each element of a datatype has an arity. The datatypes, as described below, are obtained from the atomic datatypes by applying four datatype constructors.

\paragraph*{Atomic datatypes.} Every finite ranked set is an atomic datatype. Also, an atomic datatype is the   \emph{terminal ranked set}  $\termset$ which contains exactly one element of every arity.
% \begin{align*}
% \ranked{\termset \eqdef 0 + 1 + \cdots},
% \end{align*}
% \begin{align*}
% \termset \eqdef  \underbrace{\redset{\naryterm 0, \naryterm 1, \naryterm 2,\ldots}.}_{\substack{\text{for each arity $i$, one} \\ \text{element denoted by $i$}}}
% \end{align*}  
The terminal set is called that way because it admits a unique arity preserving function from every other ranked set. 
We use the terminal set to model partial functions: a partial function with output  type  $\rSigma$ can be seen as a total function of output type $\ranked{\rSigma + \termset}$, which uses  $\termset$  for  undefined values.


\paragraph*{Terms.} The central datatype constructor is the  \emph{term} constructor, which is a generalisation of trees to higher arities. A term is a tree with dangling edges, called ports. The dangling edges ares used to decompose trees (and other terms) into smaller pieces, as  illustrated by the figure below. 
% Each  part of the tree is not a tree as it has dangling ports.  We call \emph{terms} such trees with ports. 
\mypic{15}
Formally speaking, terms are defined by induction as follows. As term over a  ranked set $\rSigma$ is either the term denoted by  $\portletter$ which consists of a port and nothing else, 
or otherwise it is an expression of the  form $a \tensorpair{t_1,\ldots,t_n}$ where $a \in \rSigma$ has arity $n$, and $t_1,\ldots,t_n$ are already defined terms. The arity of a term is the number of ports. Terms of arity zero are the same as trees. We write $\tmonad \rSigma$ for the ranked set of terms over a ranked set $\rSigma$.   Because the term constructor -- like other datatype constructors -- outputs a ranked set, it makes sense to talk about terms of terms, etc.

Terms are a monad, in the category of ranked sets and arity preserving functions\footnote{An almost identical monad is used in ~\cite[Section 9.2]{bojanczykRecognisableLanguagesMonads2015}, which differs from ours in  that it allows multiple uses of a single port.}. The unit of the monad,  an operation of type $\ranked{\rSigma \to \tmonad \rSigma}$, is illustrated in the following picture:
\mypic{98}
The product of the monad,  an operation of type $\ranked{\tmonad \tmonad \rSigma \to \tmonad \rSigma}$ that we call \emph{flattening}, is illustrated in the following picture:
\mypic{97}

\paragraph*{Products and coproducts.}
There are two binary datatype constructors
\begin{align*}
\underbrace{\ranked{\Sigma_1 \product \Sigma_2}}_{\text{product}} \qquad \underbrace{\ranked{\Sigma_1 + \Sigma_2}}_{\text{coproduct}}
\end{align*}
An element of the product is a pair $\tensorpair{a_1,a_2}$ where $a_i \in \ranked{\Sigma_i}$. The arity of the pair is the sum of arities of its two coordinates $a_1$ and $a_2$. 
% We draw pairs like this:
% \mypic{52}     
An element of the coproduct is a pair $(i,a)$ where $i \in \set{1,2}$ and $a \in \ranked{\Sigma_i}$. The arity is inherited from $a$. 

The set of terms can be defined in terms of  products and coproducts, as the least solution of the equation:
\begin{align*}
\tmonad \rSigma = \redset{\portletter}  \ranked{+\coprod_{\black {a \in} \rSigma}} 
\powersmall{(\tmonad \rSigma)} {\text{arity of $a$}}
\end{align*}  where $\ranked \coprod$ denotes possibly infinite coproduct  and $\powersmall X n$ denotes the $n$-fold product of a ranked set $\ranked X$ with itself.

\paragraph*{Folding.}
The final -- and maybe less natural -- datatype constructor called \emph{folding}. Folding has two main purposes: (1) reordering ports in a term; and (2) reducing arities by grouping ports into groups. More formally, folding is not one constructor, but a family of unary constructors $\reduce k \rSigma$, one  for every $k \in \set{1,2,3,\ldots}$.  An $n$-ary element of $\reduce k \rSigma$, which is called a \emph{$k$-fold}, consists of an element      $a \in \rSigma$  together with an injective    \emph{grouping}  function
\begin{align*}
    f :  \underbrace{\set{1,\ldots,\text{arity of $a$}}}_{\substack{\text{an element of this set is}\\\text{called a  port of $a$}}} \to \underbrace{\set{1,\ldots,n} \times \set{1,\ldots,k} }_{\text{these pairs are called \emph{sub-ports}}}
\end{align*}
We denote such an element as $a/f$ and draw it like this: \mypic{53}
In the above picture there are $4 \times 3$ sub-ports.

Already for $k=1$, the constructor $\reduce 1$ is non-trivial. For example,  $\reduce 1 \tmonad \rSigma$ is a generalisation of terms where ports are not necessarily ordered left-to-right (because the grouping function need not be monotone), and some ports need not appear (because the grouping function need not be total); in other words this is the same as terms in the usual sense of universal algebra, with the restriction that each variable is used at most once (sometimes called linearity).

When viewed as a family of datatype constructors,  folds have a monad-like structure: they are a graded  monad in the sense of~\cite[p. 518]{fujiShinyaMellies2016}. The unit is the operation 
\mypic{98}
of type $\ranked{\Sigma \to \reduce 1 \Sigma}$, while  the product (or flattening) in the graded monad is the family of operations of type 
\begin{align*}
    \ranked{\reduce {k_2} \reduce {k_1} \Sigma \to \reduce {k_1 \cdot k_2} \Sigma},
\end{align*}
indexed by $k_1,k_2 \in \set{1,2,\ldots}$, that is illustrated below:
\mypic{100}
More formally, the flattening of a double fold $(a/{f_1})/{f_2}$ has the grouping function defined by
\begin{align*}
    % \label{eq:fold-grouping}
i \mapsto (i_2, \underbrace{(q_1 -1)k_2 + q_2}_{\substack{\text{bijection between} \\ \set{1,\ldots,k_1} \times \set{1\ldots,k_2} \\ \text{and $\set{1,\ldots,k_1k_2}$}}}) \qquad \text{where} \begin{cases}
    (i_1,p_1) &= f_1(i)\\
    (i_2,p_2) &= f_2(i_1)
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
% $k=2$, $n=4$, and $a$ has arity $a$. There  The groups are  and the arity of $a$ is 6, and $f$ is
% \begin{align*}
% \begin{array}{rccccccc}
%     i \in \set{1,\ldots,\arity a} &  \quad &1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
%     \text{group of $f(i)$} &  & 1 & 1 & 4 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
%     \text{position of $f(i)$} & & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 
% \end{array}
% \end{align*}
% A term has an arity, which is  the number of ports. Because the set of terms is itself a ranked set,  we can create terms of terms.  In fact, all of the datatypes and datatype constructors  work with ranked sets.


% A consequence of using terms is that we  work in the category of ranked sets; i.e.~our datatypes represent ranked sets and the functions we consider are arity-preserving functions between ranked sets.  As mentioned before, we use  red for ranked sets; we also use red  for operations that output ranked sets. 

%\footnote{This is a difference of trees as opposed to strings~\cite{bojanczykRegularFirstOrderList2018}, where ranked sets are not needed, because a part of a string is also a string.}
 
%
%
%The crucial property of the prime functions and  the combinators is that they use ranked sets. This is because the type constructor of this paper, namely terms, uses ranked sets.  Roughly speaking, a term is a tree with missing parts. The missing parts arise when we  isolate smaller parts of a bigger tree, as illustrated in the following picture:




%\begin{definition}[Terms]\label{def:terms}
%    An  term\footnote{
%        Our definition of terms differs from the definition used in universal algebra. An $n$-ary term in the sense of this paper is, in the language of universal algebra, a term over variables $\set{x_1,\ldots,x_n}$ where each variable appears exactly once, and the variables are used from left to right.  The requirement that variables appear  once is related to the linear output size of first-order tree-to-tree transductions. Without this requirement, even homomorphisms would have exponential output size. 
%    } over a ranked set $\rSigma$ is a tree over alphabet $\rSigma \redplus \redzero$, where $\redzero$ is a set with one element of arity zero.  The nodes with labels from $\redzero$  -- which are leaves --  are called \emph{ports}. The arity of a term is the number of ports.  We write $\tmonad \rSigma$ for the ranked set of terms over $\rSigma$.

 This completes the list of  datatype constructors.  
 \begin{definition}[Datatypes]
    \label{def:types}  
        The \emph{datatypes} is the least class of ranked sets which contains all finite ranked sets, the terminal set, and which is closed under applying the constructors 
        \begin{align*}

\subsection{Derivable functions}
We now present the central definition of this paper. 

% The derivable functions are those that can be constructed by applying certain combinators to  certain primitive functions. Apart from function composition, the  combinators are simply liftings of functions along the datatype constructors, in the following sense. If the sense  that  arity preserving functions
% \begin{align*}
% \ranked{f_1 : \Sigma_1 \to \Gamma_1 \qquad f_2 : \Sigma_2 \to \Gamma_2}
% \end{align*}       
% can be lifted, in the natural way, along the type constructors to new arity preserving  functions
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \label{eq:liftplus}\funcitem{f_1 + f_2}{\Sigma_1 + \Sigma_2}{\Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2} \\
% \funcitem{\tensorpair{f_1,f_2}}{\Sigma_1 \product \Sigma_2}{\Gamma_1 \product \Gamma_2}\\
% \funcitem{\reduce k f_1}{\reduce k \Sigma_1}{\reduce k \Gamma_1}\\
% \label{eq:liftterm}
% \funcitem{\tmonad f_1}{\tmonad \Sigma_1}{\tmonad \Gamma_1}
% %\\\label{eq:liftshallow}\funcitem{\shallowterm{f_1}{f_2}}{\shallowterm{\Sigma_1}{\Sigma_2}}{\shallowterm {\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_2}} 
% \end{eqnarray}

% The datatypes are then defined by applying the constructors to the prime datatypes, which are either finite ranked sets (those with finitely many elements), or  the terminal ranked set (i.e.~a ranked set which admits a unique function from every other ranked set).
% We call such ranked sets \emph{types}.
%  The general idea is that we start with finite ranked sets, and close these under the following type constructors: coproducts, two kinds of product (Cartesian and tensor), taking terms, and a type constructor that allows to merge ports.
%  and the matrix power. 
% The  matrix power -- which is possibly the least natural type constructor -- will be motivated and discussed in more detail later on.




\begin{definition}[Derivable function]\label{def:derivable-function}
    An  arity preserving function between two datatypes is called \emph{derivable}  if it can be generated, by using the combinators in Figure~\ref{fig:combinators}, from  the following prime functions:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item for every $\rSigma$, the unique arity preserving function $\ranked{\Sigma \to \termset}$;
    \item  all arity preserving functions with finite domain;
        \item  the prime functions in Figures~\ref{fig:monad},\ref{fig:product} and \ref{fig:not-explained};
         \end{itemize}
% \end{enumerate}
  

   
\end{definition}

\input{functions-reduced}

%\include{figure-fot}
The combinators in Figure~\ref{fig:combinators} are  function composition, and the natural liftings of functions along the datatype constructors. 
The prime functions in Figure~\ref{fig:monad} describe the monad structure of terms and folds, and were explained in Section~\ref{sec:datatype-constructors}. The prime functions in Figure~\ref{fig:product} are  simple syntactic transformations, which are intended to have no computational content.  Figure~\ref{fig:not-explained} contains   less obvious operations, whose definitions are  deferred to Section~\ref{sec:prime-and-combinators}. 
% Before giving these definitions, we state the main result of the paper. 

\input{example-derivable}

% \begin{example}
%     To get a feeling for the prime functions and combinators, we derive the function
%     \begin{align*}
%     \tensorpair{a,b} \in \ranked{\rSigma^2} \qquad \mapsto \qquad  \tensorpair{b,a} \in \ranked{\rSigma^2}
%     \end{align*}
%     which witnesses commutativity of the product for pairs of the same type. The idea is to embed pairs into terms, and use simple manipulations on terms. 
%     We  draw the unique elements of the sets $\redzero$, $\redone$ and $\redtwo$ as follows:
%     \mypic{79}
%     We begin by deriving a function which maps a tensor pair into a shallow term whose root is the unique element of $\redtwo$.  This is achieved by composing the derivable functions of types 
%     \begin{align*}
%     \ranked{
%         \xymatrix{
%             \rSigma \product \rSigma \ar[r] &
%             (\shallowterm \redone \rSigma) \product (\shallowterm \redone \rSigma) \ar[r] &
%             \shallowterm{(\redone \product \redone)}  {(\rSigma+\rSigma)} \ar[r] & \shallowterm \redtwo \rSigma
%         }
%     }
%     \end{align*}
%     which is described in the following picture:
%     \mypic{78}
%     The last function applies the bijection $\ranked{\redone \product \redone \to \redtwo}$, which is derivable by virtue of having a finite domain. 

%     Next, we can swap the children of 
% \end{example}

% We first observe that terms and unary folding are monads. 
% The monad structure for terms is induced by:
% \begin{align*}
%         \underbrace{\ranked {\tmonad f : \tmonad \Sigma \to \tmonad \Gamma}}_{\text{$\tmonad$ is a functor}} \qquad  \underbrace{\unit_\rSigma : \rSigma \rto \tmonad \rSigma}_{\text{the unit in the monad}} \qquad  \underbrace{\flatt_\rSigma : \tmonad \tmonad \rSigma \rto \tmonad \rSigma}_{\text{the product operation in the monad}},
% \end{align*}
% and a similar situation holds for unary folds $\reduce 1$.  More generally, the family of folds $\set{\reduce k}_{k}$ is a graded monad. Finally, the operation $\tmonad \reduce 1 \rSigma \rto \reduce 1 \tmonad \rSigma$ is a distributive law of these two monads.

% For a derivable function, its domain and co-domain are types as in Definition~\ref{def:types}, in particular the domain and co-domain are ranked sets. The prime functions are arity-preserving and the combinators preserve this property, and therefore all derivable functions are arity-preserving. 


% We are now ready to state the main theorem of this paper. 

We say that a tree-to-tree function  
    \begin{align*}
        f : \trees \rSigma \to \trees \rGamma
    \end{align*}
    is \emph{derivable} if it agrees on arguments that are trees with some derivable partial function
    \begin{align*}
        \ranked {f : \tmonad \Sigma \to \tmonad \Gamma + \termset}.
    \end{align*}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main} A tree-to-tree function is a first-order transduction if and only if it is derivable.
\end{theorem}


The right-to-left implication in the above theorem is proved by a relatively straightforward induction on the derivation. The general idea is that we associate to each datatype a relational structure; for example the relational structure associated to a pair $\tensorpair {a_1,a_2}$ is the disjoint union of the relational structures associated to $a_1$ and $a_2$.  In the appendix, we show that all prime functions are first-order transductions (adapted suitably to structures other than trees); and that this property is preserved under applying the combinators. There is one nontrivial step in the proof, which concerns monotone unfolding, and will be discussed below.  

The  left-to-right implication in the theorem, which says that every first-order transduction is derivable, is the main contribution of this paper, and is discussed in Sections~\ref{sec:stt}--\ref{sec:one-register}.
%\subsection{Proposition of another presentation of prime functions}


%\input{functions}
\subsection{The prime functions from Figure~\ref{fig:not-explained}}
\label{sec:prime-and-combinators}
In this section, we  describe the prime functions from Figure~\ref{fig:not-explained}. 
Each of these functions will play a key role in one of the main results of the paper.
%  We will highlight the moments when such functions are used.  


\subsubsection{Factorisations}
\label{sec:factorisation-functions}
We begin with the two factorisation functions 
\begin{align*}
    \ancfact,\decfact  : \ranked{\tmonad(\Sigma_1+\Sigma_2) \to \tmonad(\tmonad \Sigma_1 + \tmonad \Sigma_2)},
\end{align*}
% \begin{align*}
%     \overbrace{\ancfact}^{\text{ancestor}}, \overbrace{\decfact}^{\text{descendant}}  : \ranked{\tmonad(\Sigma_1+\Sigma_2) \to \tmonad(\tmonad \Sigma_1 + \tmonad \Sigma_2)}.
% \end{align*}
which are used to factorise  terms into smaller parts. 
Define a \emph{factorisation} of a term   to be any term of terms that flattens to it.  An alternative view is that a factorisation is an equivalence relation on nodes in a term, where every equivalence class is connected via the parent-child relation.
% Another definition is that  a factorisation is an equivalence relation on non-port nodes where every equivalence class is a factor (connected via the parent-child relation). 
    % The two definitions are easily seen to be equivalent, in the sense that there is a one-to-one correspondence between factorisation in the two meanings.
    %  which is explained in the following picture:
    % \mypic{14}

% The factorisation functions $\ancfact$ and $\decfact$ are used to transform a term  into a factorisation in a way that is guided by the partition of the input alphabet.  
Consider an  term $t \in \ranked{\tmonad(\rSigma_1 + \rSigma_2)}$.
        We say that two nodes have the \emph{same type} if both have labels in the same  $\ranked{\Sigma_i}$; otherwise we say that nodes have \emph{opposing type}. Define  two equivalence relations on  nodes in a term as follows: (a) nodes are called  \emph{$\uparrow$-equivalent}  if they have the same type and the same proper ancestors of opposing type; (b) nodes are  called  \emph{$\downarrow$-equivalent}  if they  are $\uparrow$-equivalent and have the same proper descendants of opposing type.
           Here is a picture of the equivalence classes, with $\ranked{\Sigma_1}$ being red and $\ranked{\Sigma_2}$ being blue: 
        \mypic{111}
    %     \begin{center}
    %   \includegraphics[scale=.3]{facto-up-down.pdf}
    %     \end{center}
        For both  equivalence relations, the equivalence classes are connected  under the parent-child relation, and therefore the equivalences can be seen as factorisations. These are the factorisations  produced by the functions $\ancfact$ and $\decfact$. 
    
        \subsubsection{Pre-order traversal.} The pre-order traversal function  
        \begin{align*}
            \ranked{\preorder : \tmonad \Sigma \to \reduce 1 \tmonad (\rSigma + \redset{\grayball,\grayballbin})}
        \end{align*}
        is the natural extension -- from trees to terms -- of the pre-order function in Example~\ref{ex:pre-order-main}. The fold in the output type is used to reorder the ports in a way which matches the input term, as illustrated in the following picture:
        \mypic{113}
      

\input{unfold}
%\subsubsection{Unfolding}
%The general idea behind the  unfolding operation 
%\begin{align*}
%\ranked{
%    \unfoldsmall : \shallowterm {(\reduce k   \Sigma)} {\Gamma^k} \to \reduce 1 (\shallowterm \Sigma \Gamma)
%}
%\end{align*} 
%is to eliminate a $k$-fold by matching it with a $k$-th power. 
%The unfolding operation is explained in the following picture for $k=2$: 
%        \begin{center}
%        \includegraphics[scale=.36]{shallow-unfold.pdf}
%        \end{center}


% One of the main results in this paper will be  that an iterated version of the unfold operation, of type
% \begin{align*}
% \ranked{    \tmonad (\reduce k \Sigma^k) \to \reduce k (\tmonad \Sigma)^k,}
% \end{align*}
% can be derived from the other operations. 

% The formal definition is

% (a\tensorpair{b_{f(1)},\ldots,b_{f(\arity a)}})/g
% \end{align*}
% where $g$ is defined so that it matches ...
